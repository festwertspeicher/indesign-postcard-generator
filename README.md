##indesign helper script for creating postcards

Used this tool to migrate lots of postcards to a new design layout.
To help the customer with his data i created a image database web application for him.
After he imported all his pictures, article numbers, EAN-barcode numbers and the article description of the postcards I could download them in a sorted way along with a CSV-file containing all the information i need to create these simple cards. I used this script to automate the process and generate printable PDF files as requested from the printing house. The Script uses the settings from your last PDF-Export.

I've used [basil.js](https://github.com/basiljs/basil.js/) and this [barcode generator](https://github.com/Holger-Will/barcode-font-generator). Thank you!
